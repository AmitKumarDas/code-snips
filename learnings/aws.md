### K8s using AWS Persistent Volume

Various parameters to create a PV.

- type: 
  - io1, gp2, sc1, st1. 
  - See AWS docs for details. Default: gp2.

  - If not specified, a random zone from those where Kubernetes cluster has a node is chosen.

- iopsPerGB: 
  - only for io1 volumes. 
  - I/O operations per second per GiB. 
  - AWS volume plugin multiplies this with size of requested volume to compute IOPS of the volume and caps it at 20 000 IOPS 
    - 20 000 maximum supported by AWS, see AWS docs. 
    - A string is expected here, i.e. "10", not 10.

- encrypted: 
  - denotes whether the EBS volume should be encrypted or not. 
  - Valid values are "true" or "false". A string is expected here, i.e. "true", not true.

- kmsKeyId: 
  - optional.
  - The full Amazon Resource Name of the key to use when encrypting the volume. 
  - If none is supplied but encrypted is true, a key is generated by AWS. See AWS docs for valid ARN value.
