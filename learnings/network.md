> Fan trades access to one **user-selected /8 (potentially external) address range** 
  for an expanded pool of “organisation-internal” addresses to be used by containers
  or virtual machines. Fan does this by mapping the addresses in a way that can be 
  computed, **rather than one that requires maintenance of distributed state** (e.g., routing tables).
