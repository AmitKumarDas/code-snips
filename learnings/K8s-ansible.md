### What is this K8s Ansible all about ?

I will try make you learn both i.e. Kubernetes through Ansible or vice-versa.

```yaml
Modular Approach:
  - Ansible supports it well
  - Write module in any language
  - Communicate with standard json
Config:
  - YAML
Ansible interacts with clients:
  - via client CLI
  - via its playbook i.e. configuration scripts
```
